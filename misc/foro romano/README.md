# Foro  Romano

I was reading Fasti by Ovid and something about the Forum Romanum set off a lighbulb in my head.

## Review

Foro Romano was fun to make and test. Seems like there were lots of different ways to solve. It was placed under Misc to be a fun programming challenge. Foro Romano, the place (most celebrated meeting place in the world + the center/heart of Ancient Rome), was hinting at a way you could solve it (meet in the middle).

Of course, there were lots of other ways to solve it. I've seen teams use Mathematica, Sage, Z3, Gaussian Elimination, and more.
